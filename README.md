Developed by: D. Piccoli, A. Santopaolo(2020).

Supervisor: prof. Fanny Ficuciello (University of Naples Federico II)


<h2>Project description</h2>

The research activity consists in the development of adaptive control algorithms for the automatic adjustment of the level of assistance to be provided to the patient in rehabilitation on the basis of the interpretation of movement intentions and the progress made in the recovery of motor functions. The platform of interest is Kuka MED Robot.

<h2>Implementation details</h2>
  
 Work in progress ... A briefly explanation of the work in the ongoing report (Only in italian for the moment!)
 
 
<h2>Testing</h2>

Different test has been realized to test the efficiency of the controller. The position one work well, still improving the force controller.
Begore to launch Test.m, run Path_robot and Corke_model.
